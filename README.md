## Pointer Types

### What are pointer types?
It is a variabe that holds the memory address of another type, specifically to unmanaged types (Rajesh, 2023).
### Why are they used?
Allow the programmer to directly manipulate memory in an unsafe environment where certain operations that would not work are now possible (Gunderman, 2023). 
### Why do they require unsafe context?
It runs outside the control of a garbage collector. Unsafe keyword can be used as a modifier to a method, property and constructor (Rajesh, 2023).
